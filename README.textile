h2. OpenInTextMate.app

Toolbar script by "Henryk Nyh":http://henrik.nyh.se, based on work by "Simon Dorfman":http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/1037

bq.. Clicking the toolbar icon now opens the selected file or files if there is a selection; otherwise it opens the current directory. You can also drag-and-drop files to the icon to open those.

Behind the scenes, the script is all AppleScript, without dropping into the shell. Feels a bit more robust.

A single TextMate window will open, containing all selected or dropped items in a project.

h3. Installation

Copy the @.app@ somewhere (I keep it along side other scripts in @/Applications/Scripts@), then drag it onto the Finder toolbar.

h3. Icons

The default icon has been replaced with an icon mathcing Snow Leopard also available in the original blog post.
